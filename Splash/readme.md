## Getting Started

Add Gradle dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
   compile 'com.appus.splash:1.0.0'
}
```

```
Now you can use any widget in **com.rey.material.widget** package as you wish. For styling, please view [Wiki](https://github.com/rey5137/Material/wiki). Note that default style of widgets depend on theme of AppCompat. Here is an example:

```xml
     <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">
        <!-- Customize your theme here. -->

        <!-- colorPrimary is used for the default action bar background -->
        <item name="colorPrimary">@color/colorPrimary</item>

        <!-- colorPrimaryDark is used for the status bar -->
        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>

        <!-- colorAccent is used as the default value for colorControlActivated
             which is used to tint widgets -->
        <item name="colorAccent">@color/colorAccent</item>

        <!-- You can also set colorControlNormal, colorControlActivated
             colorControlHighlight & colorSwitchThumbNormal. -->
    </style>
```
